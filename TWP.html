        <!-- <t4>About</t4> -->
<p> Coding is at the core of one ofthe most transformative changes in technology in the 21st century,
    across almost all facets of culture. Whether it be 2 scientists sharing sensitive data with one another
    from different ends of the globe, doing some online shopping for a new phone, or needing to call
    a last-minute Uber, coding is nigh ubiquitous. With that being said, one might be able to surmise
    how programmers are beneficial to society, and how a litle coding might (maybe) do everyone some good.
    Below, are just a few examples of some JavaScript fundamentals, in the hopes of being a demonstration
    of just how simple and accessible such a vastly complex and powerful tool can  be. (At least at this level.)

    A function in Javascript is "a block of code designed to perform a particular task. ... A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it)."
        This is simply asking (or telling) the code to do something for you. A more technical and logical way of stating a demand.

            Conditional statements are the set of commands used to perform different actions based on different conditions. JavaScript supports two conditional statements: if...else and switch.
            This is about as simple as anything else. Imagine what you'll wear outside on a given day: If it rains, you may wear a hoodie. Otherwise (or else), you might wear a tank top.
            You set conditions that must be satisfied to perform your task, and a back-up in case it is not what you'd expect.

    In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object. All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects. Or in other words, as long as a value has properties or methods, it is an object.
